1. Implement authenticated view
   Only do DCR if not done already

2. Implement the new view operations
   Get token refresh working
   Get end session working

3. ApplicationStateManager and AuthState to think more about
   Simple code and thread safety

ANDROID
------
Pass ApplicationConfig into constructor of AppAuthHandler
Only update ApplicationStateManager on a single thread
Test on supported versions and real devices, including changing orientation
